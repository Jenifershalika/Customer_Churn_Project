# Customer_Churn_Project
# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
Predict whether a customer will **churn** (leave a telecom service) using **machine learning**.  
Demonstrates a complete workflow: data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Dataset
- **File:** `telco_churn.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains customer details like tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and churn status.

---

## Key Steps
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature encoding and scaling  
4. Logistic Regression model training  
5. Model evaluation using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**  
6. Business insights for retention strategies

---

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved **79.18% accuracy**  
- Identified customers likely to churn for targeted retention actions

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, StandardScaler, train_test_split)  
- joblib (optional: for saving the model)
